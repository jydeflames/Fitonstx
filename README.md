# 🏃‍♂️ **FitOnSTX: Move to Own Real Assets on Stacks**

## 📌 Overview

**FitOnSTX** is a decentralized fitness rewards protocol built on **Stacks (STX)** that turns your daily physical activity into **fractional ownership of real-world assets** — including real estate, tokenized commodities, and more. Walk, run, or bike in the real world, and grow your on-chain portfolio as you move.

## ❗️The Problem

Modern fitness apps offer short-term perks:

* Points with limited utility
* In-app token rewards with unstable economies
* Gated access to premium features

But **none of them help you build wealth**.

At the same time:

* Asset ownership is **inaccessible** for many
* The path to **financial independence** is disconnected from physical health
* There's **no long-term reward** for consistent fitness habits

## ✅ The FitOnSTX Solution

FitOnSTX merges **health and wealth** by rewarding real-world motion with real-world value.
